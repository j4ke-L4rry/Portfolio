    <p class="welcome">Welcome to my portfolio! I built this using HTML and CSS to share more about myself. 
        This is my first year in the program, Computer Science. 
        I have always been curious about how computers work since I was 12 years old.
        Feel free to check out my photos, family, and about me section to learn more about me outside coding.
