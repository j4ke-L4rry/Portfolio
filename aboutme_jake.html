            <p>Hi! I am Jake Larry Villacarlos Gonzales, but you can simply call me Jake.
             I’m a first-year Computer Science student at the <a href="https://universityofbohol.edu.ph/">University of Bohol.</a>
             Since I was 12, I’ve dreamed of pursuing this program because of my passion for computers and my curiosity about how software works.
             </p>

             <p>Why UB? My family has a long history with the University, 
                even before it officially became one. 
                Many of them studied or worked here. 
                My grandmother graduated when it was still Rafael Palma College, and my uncle, Eng. Liberato Lupot Jr., served as the CETAFA dean. 
                Several relatives continue to teach and work in the institution today.</p>

             <p>Both of my parents also have ties to UB. My father, Joseph Larry Lupot Gonzales, finished his high school education here, 
                while my mother, Laarni Villacarlos Gonzales, 
                studied at the College of Law and later taught as a college instructor for four years.
             </p>

             <p>I chose UB because it’s close to home and feels comfortable — almost like an extension of home itself. 
                The environment is familiar, welcoming, and supportive, 
                which makes it easier for me to focus on my studies and grow both academically and personally.
                I hope that this program will open opportunities for me and guide me toward achieving my career goals. 
                Thank you for taking the time to read my story.

             </p>
