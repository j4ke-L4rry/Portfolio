        Hi! I am <b>Jake Larry Villacarlos Gonzales</b>, but you can simply call me <b>Jake</b>.
        I'm a first-year Computer Science student at the 
        <!-- I wanted to put a link that redirects to the University webpage-->
		<a href="https://universityofbohol.edu.ph/" style="color:yellow;">University of Bohol.</a>
        Since I was 12, I've dreamed of pursuing this program because of my passion for computers and my curiosity about how software works.
    </p>

    <p style="color:white;">
        Why <abbr title="University of Bohol">UB</abbr>? My family has a long history with the University, 
        even before it officially became one. 
        Many of them studied or worked here. 
        <span style="color:yellow;">My grandmother graduated when it was still Rafael Palma College, and my uncle, Eng. Liberato Lupot Jr., served as the CETAFA dean. 
        Several relatives continue to teach and work in the institution today.</span>
    </p>

    <p style="color:white;"> 
              <span style="color:skyblue;">Both of my parents also have ties to UB.</span> 
        My father, Joseph Larry Lupot Gonzales, finished his high school education here, 
        while my mother, Laarni Villacarlos Gonzales, studied at the College of Law and later taught as a college instructor for four years.
    </p>
	
	<aside>
		<h5 style="color:white;">College of Law </h5>
		<p style="color:white;">The University of Bohol College of Law was established in 1946, the same year the school was founded as Rafael Palma College,
		making it one of the earliest professional programs offered by the institution. 
		It has since produced generations of lawyers, judges, and public servants in Bohol and beyond.
		</p>
		<section>
    <p style="color:white;">
        <span style="color:red;">I chose UB because it's close to home and feels comfortable - almost like an extension of home itself.</span>
        The environment is familiar, welcoming, and supportive, 
        which makes it easier for me to focus on my studies and grow both academically and personally.
        I hope that this program will open opportunities for me and guide me toward achieving my career goals. 
        Thank you for taking the time to read my story.

    Great teachers pair strong human <br>qualities (empathy, patience, respect) with high-impact instructional 
    skills (engagement, adaptability,</br>
    creativity) to meet diverse learners' needs. Adaptability and lifelong 
    learning are essential as student populations, technology, and learning science continue to evolve.
